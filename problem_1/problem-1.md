Problem 1
===
An anagram is a word formed from another by rearranging its letters, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse.

Write a function that checks if two words are each other's anagrams.

For example, AreAnagrams.are_anagrams?('momdad', 'dadmom') should return *true* as arguments are anagrams.

#####Module Code

```
module AreAnagrams
	def self.are_anagrams?(string_a, string_b)
		raise NotImplementedError, "Not implemented"
	end
end
```
